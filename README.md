# ChaTrade

## Purpose

The purpose of ChaTrade is to connect registered users to one another via chat rooms so they can practice speaking different languages with each other. The idea being that if person A is a native English speaker and wants to practice his Japanese, person B who is a native Japanese can practice their english with them at the same time.

The site isn't particularly well suited for teaching absolute beginners but rather for intermediates to practice what they've learned previously with native speakers of their desired language.
